# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
---
### Purpose
The purpose of the final web app is to store data on UFO sightings. Further, the webpage is also a central location for users to query the database on a multitude of filters. 

### Details
The data used to store, sort, query, and present the UFO sighting information is stored as a JavaScript array. On the front end, the data is presented to the user as a table. The table is very dynamic; capable of being queried on any combination of five different filters as per the users' selection.

### Programming Languages and other Software Used
* JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and VS Code

## Results
The primary objective of this project was to build a dynamic webpage; enabling user interaction on multiple table filter search criteria including: 
* Date
* City 
* State
* Country
* Shape 
Once the user has selected a singular/combination of filter criteria into the designated filter boxes, the web page will dynamically return a table consisting of all the data matching the user's inputs. The image below displays what the webpage will look like before any filters have been applied to the table:

Next, the image below depicts an example of what a user could input into the search filters:

Once the user inputs his/her desired search criteria, he/she will simply have to press the enter key on their keyboard for the web page to present the associated results, like so:

Then, if the user wishes to perform another search, he/she has two options. The first option is to navigate to the top left corner and click on the text, "UFO Sightings" as the green arrows in the below image are pointing to:

The user's second option is to reload their web-browser. Both of these options will result in the default table being displayed as well as cleared filters, thereby allowing the web page to perform a new query.
